To run properly you must do two things, first run the following command to run the container:
docker run -it     --env="DISPLAY"     --env="QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1"     --volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw"     raspcar

Than run cd Adeept-PiCar-B/client and open client.py with vi
Go down to where the defiinition of the loop function is, and comment out the three lines that involve the logo, no you should be able to run it with python3
